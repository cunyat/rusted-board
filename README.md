This is an attempt to build a chess engine while learning rust in the way :)

For the moment, the engine is not fully functional. It can generate moves
for both sides and do some moves, but it does not take into account checks
or other stuff like discovering attacks or castling ðŸ¥²

I'll try to add features onto it, but my holidays are near to end :D
